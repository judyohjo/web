- **Reason for creating the website:** I realised there weren't any websites/platforms that integrates selling/buying, sharing stories, sharing course reviews and etc. 

# Creating profile for students
- **Information required:** Student name, name of the University/Tertiary education


# Programming language
- HTML/CSS frontend language for design of the website
- PHP script language for creating a server page
- SQL database language for storing student data 
- (Software used) Using Visual Studio Code


# Systems / Data / Security
- Will need multiple systems (one system to save ID and PW, where we pull out student information by using ID)
- Use SQL and database to save student information/data and retrieve their data 
- Connecting HTML website to SQL database using PHP (to create a server page and to connect to SQL)
- Security is a key here when storing student information to the student database!

# Checklist
[x] Design of the webpage (half done)
[] Connecting SQL
